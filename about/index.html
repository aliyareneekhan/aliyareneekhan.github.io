			<p> Welcome to my website! I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying Anthropology and Computer Science. I have a very scattered array of hobbies, from reading historical texts to building websites to catching up on the latest episode of Boku No Hero Academia. I am fascinated by the way people interact with one another and with technology. Each person is a ripple in a vast ocean whose decisions and existence can amplify or diminsh the ripples of others. And each person lives within their own tiny world. So there are nine billion little worlds on this planet of ours and I want to explore as many of them as I can. This website is dedicated both to showcasing my professional and academic achievements and as a place for experimentation, especially as I delve deeper into my newly acquired interest in photography and writing.

			To read my blog, click <a>here</a>. It would be impossible to define myself or my writing by a category such as sports or fashion, so the blog has a variety of miscellaneous articles ranging from lighthearted stories about my latest favorite chocolate croissant in Ann Arbor to more serious articles about my take environmental and humanitarian issues.
