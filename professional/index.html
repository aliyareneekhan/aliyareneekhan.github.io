		<h1> Projects </h1>
		<div class = "project">
			<h2>文法べんと | Bunpou Bento </h2>
			<p> Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a website to help Japanese language students with verb conjugation. The website will cover curriculum from the first year Japanese courses at the University of Michigan. </p>
		</div>

		<div class = "project">
			<h2> Loop </h2>
			<p> Worked on the website for the Loop iOS Application, a service that connects individuals to events in their community based on their interests and events previously attended. Took Google Web Analytics courses in Search Engine Optimization and Data Analysis in preparation for this internship. Created a PHP script for the company website that generates a unique and descriptive slug for each event in the database so the individual event pages in the database would be more likely to show up in a Google search. <p> 

			<p> To visit the Loop Website, click<strong><a href ="http://getloop.me/" style ="font-weight: bold;
    color: #dc42f4;"> here </a></strong></p>

		<div class = "project">
			<h2> The Gabii Project </h2>
			<p> Used ArcGIS to map an archaeological site which is located in Gabii, Italy. Worked with 3D Coat, PhotoScan, and the Unity Gaming environment to turn photographs taken of the site into a user-friendly, three-dimensional, interactive virtual representation. Traveled to Gabii, Italy and received direct training in photogrammetry, 3D modeling production, and archaeological topography. The published 3D environment will greatly influence how archaeological information is recorded by preserving a visual representation of the artifacts and structures in their original contexts. </p>
